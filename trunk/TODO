to work on:

* why did the seats and each seat's player get reloaded (in general it would
  happen since it's a new request, but these objects were supposedly already in
  memory)

* why did each card get reloaded before being able to be moved from the supply
  to the hand? (note that this didn't happen for saving the cards that stayed
  in the supply)

* between updating the building_market_tile and creating the
  building_market_stocked event the game was reloaded. same thing for the
  currency market cards; this results in quite a few redundant game loads
